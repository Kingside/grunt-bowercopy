# Contributing to grunt-bowercopy

Follow the [jQuery style guide](http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/), with these exceptions:

- Use single quotes
- Multiple var statements can be used to group variable declarations logically
- Use [jsdoc-style](http://usejsdoc.org/#JSDoc3_Tag_Dictionary) comments for functions

Add tests to test/bowercopy_test.js.

If you're unfamiliar with grunt, [gruntjs.com](http://gruntjs.com/) is a good place to start. Follow instructions for installing grunt and see the Gruntfile for the tasks used.

Always run tests before submitting a pull request, unless it is just a documentation or copy change.
